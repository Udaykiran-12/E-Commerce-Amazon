ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Website Clone (Amazon Inspired)
Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, Render

Description:
Developed and deployed a full-stack e-commerce platform replicating core features of Amazon, enabling users to register, log in, browse products, manage their cart, and perform secure checkout simulations. Built with MERN stack and hosted on Render with dynamic CORS and authentication handling.

âœ… Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login/register using JWT tokens and cookie-based session management.

Product Listing & Details: Dynamic product data fetched from MongoDB with responsive UI using React.

Add to Cart: Logged-in users can add/remove items from cart (protected routes via middleware).

Cart Persistence: Cart data is linked to the authenticated user and stored in the database.

CORS & Cookie Security: Configured CORS headers to support cross-origin credentials for frontend-backend integration.

Deployment & Debugging: Identified and fixed production-level errors (e.g., path-to-regexp, cookie mismatch, CORS issues) during live deployment on Render.
